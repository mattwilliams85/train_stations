MAX RAIL MANAGER

About
This project is for the Ruby Database Basics assessment at Epicodus.

The project is a simulated manager for a rail line with trains, stations and stops.

Setup
Clone this repository or download the .zip and open up the index.html file in the browser.

How To Use: <br />
1. Without Active Record I was unable to set-up migration files you could use to set-up a local database. However, I left instructions in the DB_README.md to setup the database on your own using psql. <br />
2. Once in the correct directory, enter 'ruby main_menu.rb' into the command line. <br />
3. Make your selctions to list Trains, Station and their stops or make changes as you please. Enjoy!

Future Plans: <br />
I hope in the near future to add a functioning "train" to the program that moves through it's respective stations in real-time. Letting the user list stop times as well as the train's current location. Unfortunately I didn't have time this week :(
